# ImBlindedByTheLights

Allows you to have Static Lights in VR while keeping the normal Lightshow on the Desktop (Or the opposite!).

Commissioned by [@NoneTakenjvm]( https://github.com/NoneTakenjvm )

---

Currently compatible game versions: **1.17.0 and up**

## Install

#### You can always find the latest download in [The Releases](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_ImBlindedByTheLights/releases), simply drag the Plugin DLL into the Plugins folder

### Dependencies

- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage (Available in ModAssistant)
- **Camera2 / Camera Plus / LIV *or* builtin Smooth Camera**
	- When having neither, the desktop view is just a duplicate of your VR view, thus this obviously does not work.

### Environment compatability

Generally, this works with every environment, however on some there is issues which cause a little bit or a lot of lighting to still be visible. Compatability might improve in the future, all of this requires a lot of digging for things.

| Status |      Environment      | Note |
|:--------:|:-------------|-------|
| 💯 | The First, Origins, Triangle, Nice, Big Mirror, Dragons, KDA, Crab Rave, Panic, Rocket, Green Day (Both), Timbaland, Fit Beat, Linkin Park, Kaleidoscope, BTS, Spooky | If the Environment features Rings they probably are not in the same position as they'd be with normal Static Lights |
| ✔️ | Billie | Some things still faintly light up |
| ✖ | Interscope | Still a lot of lighting left |

### Features

- Option that allows you to keep Ring Spins active with Static lights
- Can define a custom static-color to use while keeping a different lighting preset active
- Toggles to disable specific light types (Back Lasers, Ring Lights, Rotating Lasers, Center lights)

### Incompatible Plugins

- Does currently not properly work with BS Plus' Light Intensity override
