# ImBlindedByTheLights

Allows you to have Static Lights in VR while keeping the normal Lightshow on the Desktop (Or the opposite!).

Commissioned by [@NoneTakenjvm]( https://github.com/NoneTakenjvm )

---

Currently compatible game versions: **1.17.0 and up**

## Install

#### You can always find the latest download in [The Releases](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_ImBlindedByTheLights/releases), simply drag the Plugin DLL into the Plugins folder

### Dependencies

- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage (Available in ModAssistant)
- **Camera2 / Camera Plus *or* builtin Smooth Camera**
	- When having neither, the desktop view is just a duplicate of your VR view, thus this obviously does not work.
	- Will probably work with LIV too - I dont have LIV, so I cannot confirm that.

### Environment compatability

Generally, this works with every environment, however on some there is issues which cause a little bit or a lot of lighting to still be visible. Compatability might improve in the future, all of this requires a lot of digging for things - And I'm pretty sure there is one thing left to account for which would fix most of these.
